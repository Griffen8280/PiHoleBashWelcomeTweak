# PiHoleBashWelcomeTweak
A Bash Welcome Tweak similar to Retro-Pie for PiHole

much of the code for this came from the orignal over at: https://github.com/retropie/RetroPie-Setup/blob/master/scriptmodules/supplementary/bashwelcometweak.sh  
I only updated it with a new variable and changed many of the system call backs to work independantly instead of being a part of the
overall menu system used by the RetroPie team.

simple to install just execute this on the command line  
<ul>
		<li>git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Griffen8280/PiHoleBashWelcomeTweak.git</li>
		<li>cd PiHoleBashWelcomeTweak</li>
		<li>chmod +x bashwelcometweak.sh</li>
		<li>./bashwelcometweak.sh</li>
</ul>
This will install the tweak for the user running it and contains much the same useful information as the RetroPie tweak
with an updated PiHole logo in ascii art.
